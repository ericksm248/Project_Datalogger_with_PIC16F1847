<h1 align="center">Datalogger with the PIC16F1847 and SD card</h1>
<br>

In this project I use the PIC16F1847 and an SD card. This datalogger register the voltage and current from a lithium battery charger

## How does it work?
The datalogger measures the voltage and current from a lithium battery charger using analog inputs of the PIC16F1847. These measurements are then processed by the microcontroller and stored on the SD card in a txt file. The stored data can be extracted later for further analysis on a computer. Two LEDs and a serial communication port provide real-time feedback  on the operation of the datalogger.
      

### Mplab X IDE Project
The code of the project can be opened with Mplab X IDE and works very well. The project uses the libraries: Petit Fafts and softUart.

### SD CARD library aspects
